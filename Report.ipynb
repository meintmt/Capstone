First, let's perform some basic analysis to the table, get familiar with the data, drop useless columns for simplification, and rename certain clumns for easy understanding.\n\nLooking at the table more carefully, the neighborhood name is not always regular. For example, some of these are A/B pattern. Such pattern may cause problem when getting the Latitude/Longitude information from the Geocode. In this case, it will be split into 2 more new columns for A & B. There are some neighborhoods have parenthesis, and it may cause similar issues. This will also be taken care using the lambda function. Once all the columns are created, a loop with priority will be set to get the geocode information.\n\nOnce the longitude and lengitude information are successfully achieved, a good check will be performed using the Folium to create maps showing the neighborhoods. This will present the neighborhoods of the Houston city to confirm the data were collected correctly.\n\nThe next step will use the Foursquare credential to get the venues information for all the neighborhoods. Foursquare can help us to get the venues with given latitude/longitude, the output is json format. We can flat that format to get data frame, grab the key information we need, and prepare a new data frame.\nAfter we have the venues information for all the neighborhoods, we will test K-Means method to group the data. Customer segmentation is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. In our case, it is unsupervised. And K-means can group data based on the similarity of neighborhoods to each other.\n",

The number size of each group are: Group_0 - 11 Group_1 - 37 Group_2 - 7 Group_3 - 24 Group_4 - 2 Group_5 - 6\n\nThe biggest group has 37, and it shows the wide spread of the restaurants. This makes good sense as Houston is a city with name for its diversity and good food. Due to weather conditions, Houston is not a place with a lot of travel sites. The second largest one has 24, and it shows the shopping is a popular activity. The third one has 11, which indicates the activities around the Banking. Considering it as the oil Capital city, one can imagine how busy the banks are. The fourth group shows the coffee and fast food. The fifth one which has a number as 6, shows the real life of Houstonians, they go to supermarkets, home furniture stores, etc. The smallest one, which only has a number 2, reflects the only popular visiting area of Houston, the Memorial park area. It has a big zoo, a good outdoor park, and museums nearby. This is the place people looking for relaxation with family.\n\nThe clustering definitely can help people coming to Houston to have some ideas first. They probably won't bring kids to here for a long vacation as there is no Disney or Lego Land. For people who likes various food, they probably will have a good impression of the city. If that's a business trip, then it's perfect probably. For anyone who likes to shopping, Houston is also a good choice, it has everything from regular to luxury. Overall, people will find the part they like Houston, and the part Houston is missing.\n",
